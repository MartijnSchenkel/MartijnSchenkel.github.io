I study evolutionary biology, particularly aiming to understand the fundamental principles that underlie evolutionary change - how are biological entities such as genes and organisms bestowed with a capacity to undergo adaptation? How do conflicts between such entities play out, such as in genetic conflicts between different parts of the genome? And what happens when conflict arises between entities on different levels, given that these are organized in a nested hierarchical fashion? I am also interested in how evolution can act to modify the basic properties of living entities, such as their reproductive mechanisms and life cycles. These properties dictate how they transmit their genetic material and thus 'eternalize' their traits - adaptations, if you will - but yet these same properties can be modified by evolution as well. How does this affect the manner in which selection begets adaptative evolution?

Above all, I am interested in the intersection between these two questions - how can we understand evolutionary change, given that the principles by which it occurs and the agents it involves can be so variable?
